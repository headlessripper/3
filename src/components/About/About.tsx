              <p>
              &quot;To Teach is To Touch Someone&apos;s Life Forever!&quot; is my underlying philosophy. I am responsible for Grade 12 Mathematics, Physical Science & Accounting. Moreover, I am also responsible for Grade 11 Mathematics and Accounting.  
                From day one, my students notice the improvement in their abilities and overall comprehension. Each student has a unique learning style, and itâ€™s my duty to find out what that is and adapt my lessons accordingly.
