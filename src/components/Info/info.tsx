              <h3>Pastor Kurwyn Adams</h3>
              <p>
                I am the founder of the Academy, and my guiding philosophy is{" "}
                <span>&quot;To Teach is To Touch Someone&apos;s Life Forever.&quot;</span> 
                Currently, I serve as the Deputy Principal at Fred Norman Secondary School, 
                where my ambit of responsibilities includes overseeing curriculum delivery 
                integrated with E-Learning, especially in STEM subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the academy, I oversee Grade 11-12 Mathematics, Physical Science, and Accounting.
                I firmly believe that from the very first day, my learners begin to see tangible 
                improvements in their skills and overall understanding. Each learner has a unique 
                learning style, and it&apos;s my responsibility to identify it and tailor my lessons 
                to support their growth and success.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I am the youth pastor at RocBreed Youth Ministries in Ennerdale. 
                With faith in God, I strive to be a vessel for positive change, helping young people 
                thrive in all aspects of their lives.
              </p>
              <p>I look forward to meeting you. üôèüèª</p>
